##Experience

### Opower
**Product Manager** from 2013 - 2016 in San Francisco, CA and Washington, DC
* End-to-end owner of a suite of consumer-oriented web-based energy management tools. Authored PRD, worked intimately with UX research, design, two engineering teams, analytics, marketing and client managers to successfully launch multiple products to millions of users.
* Founded a cross-functional team to prioritize and design A/B tests across Opower's web-based products.
* Prioritized deep-dive analysis of customer behavior on products post-launch. The resulting data led to actionable insights for both the core product and the clients who configure them for themselves.
* Led a year-long project to refactor our web offering to conform with strict Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0 AA).
